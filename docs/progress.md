# Weft implementation ledger

Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-21-weft.md
Spec: docs/spec.md

## Decisions

- User explicitly approved implementation, so proceed without a second plan-approval interruption.
- Native execution with a fresh final review. All changes stay in the original directory as requested.
- A repository was initialized inside residual to avoid committing the unrelated parent home repository.
- User authorized 50 RMB total real evaluation. DEEPSEEK_API_KEY was absent at initial inspection;
  user replied OK about configuration, so verify actual availability before paid calls.
- Shared interfaces: domain -> provider/tools -> runtime -> CLI/evaluation. Typed public contracts
  live in the relevant modules and are verified through integration tests, not duplicated definitions.

## Status

- Task 1: complete — watched goal tests fail (2/3), then evidence/budget/store tests fail (6/9).
  `cargo test` passed 9/9 integration tests. SQLite reopen, stale evidence, local requirement updates,
  omitted criteria and budget reservation behavior are exercised.
- Ruling: use `Goal::missing_evidence` rather than a boolean `can_finish`; the runtime needs the
  missing requirement IDs to continue useful work. Cost if wrong: interface rename only.
- Task 2: provider/context core complete — local HTTP transport and fragmented SSE exercised;
  watched four transport/context tests fail, then malformed-call identity regression fail.
  `cargo test`: 16/16 passed. Real DeepSeek calls remain unperformed.
- Ruling: rate-limit retries happen in transport; potentially billable 5xx retries require a new
  runtime budget reservation rather than hiding several uncertain calls behind one allowance.
  Cost if wrong: fewer automatic retries, not unaccounted spend.
- Task 3 core: hash-guarded create/replace/delete, real PTY process groups, source search,
  tool dispatch authorization and requirement leases, web HTTP transport/limits implemented.
  Watched 7 base tool tests fail, then stale-action/service/search/web tests fail before implementation.
  `cargo test` passed 28/28. macOS sandbox-exec actually prevented source writes while allowing build output.
- Pending integration: long-lived service lifecycle, persisted quota restoration, runtime metering,
  cancellation/reconciliation and compaction remain in Task 4; don't claim a functioning agent yet.
- Official price snapshot saved in docs/pricing.md; peak-rate upper bounds will enforce the 50 RMB
  campaign cap. No paid model or search call has been made. Environment key remains absent.
- Next: runtime session state, controls, money ledger and continuous actor loop.
